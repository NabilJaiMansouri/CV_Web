Thesis topic: Deep Learning approach for ultrasonic signal processing.
- Propose a method for time-of-flight estimation on ultrasonic signals that outperforms existing methods on 99% of samples.
- Provide an Attention Unet for noise reduction on ultrasonic signals allowing for a 30 dB enhancement in SNR.
- Leverage the proposed Attention Unet for the deconvolution of overlapping echoes and conduct an improvement of the axial resolution of the final ultra- sound images.
- Implementation of these techniques in an acoustic microscope.
- Validation on Sicilium samples, allowing for precise thickness measurement and the detection of flatness defects.
